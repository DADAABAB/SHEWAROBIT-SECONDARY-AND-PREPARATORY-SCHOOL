​Shewarobit Secondary and Preparatory School, located in the town of Shewarobit in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, has been a cornerstone of education for the local community. The school offers both secondary and preparatory education, playing a crucial role in preparing students for higher education and future careers.​

In recent years, the school faced significant challenges due to conflicts that led to the looting of educational facilities in the area. In response, organizations like Dir Biyabir, in collaboration with ADHENO, initiated efforts to rehabilitate affected schools, including Shewarobit General Secondary School. These efforts involved the delivery of essential equipment such as computers, printers, generators, and laboratory machines in phases throughout 2023, aiming to restore and enhance the school's educational infrastructure. ​
